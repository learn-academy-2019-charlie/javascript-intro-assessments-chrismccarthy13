#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
    A function is a reusable block of code that you can call upon at any time. 
    It contains two parts the declaration and the call. 
    Functions usually take in data, process it, and return a result.

    A method is a function that belongs to a class. 
    It is also a procedure that is associated with a message and an object.
    
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
    String methods help you work with strings. 
    Some examples of javascript string methods are indexOf() and search().

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
    Accessor methods are used to modify without permanently changing an object. Examples include concat, join and split.
    Mutator methods permanently change objects. Examples include push, pop, unshift and shift.
    You would use one over the other depending upon if you want to permanently change an object or not.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
    Return will not log the information to the console. It is used to return something back to your program.
    A console log will log the information indcluded into the console.
    You would use console log if you want to display a string or variable in the console window.
    Return would be used to return something back to your program. The function will stop once it reads the return.
